## Description

This is a demo Android application that displays beautiful images of Earth vistas from Reddit. It was built using Xamarin and utilizes several third party libraries such as Xamarin Picasso, CheeseKnife, and Refit.

This application makes a REST call to Reddit using Refit to retrieve post data from Reddit's /r/EarthPorn sub-reddit channel, which contains posts of stunning images of landscapes around the world. The model class was auto-generated using json2csharp (http://json2csharp.com/).
